Subset Sum Problem - Parallel Dynamic Programming

Definitions:
    Int_Set := A set of random integers within a given range. Size N
    N := the number of elements in the set 
    Target := the target Sum
    Cache := the Cache of answers. A 2D array of size NxTarget of bools.
    Rank, Size := as defined by MPI

Sub-Problems:
    Initialization: -Caleb
        -Process 0 creates Int_Set and populates it with random integers in [0, 2N]
        -Process 0 creates Target in [.5*N^2, N^2]
        -Process 0 sends Int_Set and Target to all other Processes
        -Each process initializes Cache
            -0th column is all True (any set can have a subset sum of 0 due to empty set)
            -0th row is all false except 0 and Int_Set[0] columns (set of 1 int can make sum 0 and only value)

    Dynamic Programming: -Caleb
        -Cache must be computed row by row. 
        -Each process computes columns [Rank*(x),Rank*(x)+x] where x := T / Size
        -Upon completion, Process 0 returns results.

    Synchronized Message Passing: -Josh
        -On each row, once the processes are done computing, they must share their results.
        -Each process fills in the Cache with the results from the other processes. 
        -The Cache on every process must by up to date and identical to the others before proceeding to compute next row.

Possible Extenstions:
    Traceback: -Caleb
        Which subset produced our target sum?
    Closest Sum: -Josh
        If there is no subset with sum == Target, what is the closest we could get?
